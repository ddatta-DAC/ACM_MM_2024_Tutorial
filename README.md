abstract = {As the field of multimedia computing has grown rapidly, so has the need for larger datasets[5] and increased modeling capacity. Navigating this complex landscape often necessitates the use of sophisticated tools and cloud architectures, which all need to be addressed before the actual research commences. Recently, AutoML, an innovation previously exclusive to tabular data, has expanded to encompass multimedia data. This development has the potential to greatly streamline the research process, allowing researchers to shift their focus from model construction to the core content of their problems. In doing so, AutoML not only optimizes resource utilization but also boosts the reproducibility of results. The aim of this tutorial is to acquaint the multimedia community with AutoML technologies, underscoring their advantages and their practical applications in the field.},
